                <p>As stated previously, Pickle's Prehistoric Bites
                    is located near the Safari Lodge on Isla Nublar.
                    Since most people want to eat after the tour, there
                    is a main pathway from the exit of the Tour to Pickle's
                    Prehistoric Bites. Although there are other ways to get
                    there, such as the bus or even more pathways from the
                    Aviary. Just remember, if you ever get lost, conceal
                    yourself behind some rocks. But watch out for leeches!
                    A dedicated employee will search for you around an hour
                    after your disappearance.

                <h2>How to Confirm Your Reservation</h2>

                <p>
                    Confirming a reservation is as easy as pie. All you have to
                    do is call the number listed on the Reservations page, go to
                    the link provided on the Reservations page, or go old school
                    and make one in-person. When reserving a spot, please state if
                    you need disability accommodations for seating. The only information
                    you will need to provide is your name, a phone number, and a secondary
                    email address. After all of that, you're all set and the last thing you
                    have to do is show up!
