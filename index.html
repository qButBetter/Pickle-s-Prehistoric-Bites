                <p>
                    Our restaurant, Pickle's Prehistoric Bites, is located near
                    the Safari Lodge on Isla Nublar. It's not particularly hard
                    to find, although if you need a map there is one listed
                    below. The Safari Lodge is located near the top center
                    of Isla Nublar. A general overview of the outside of
                    the restaurant is a flashy, overgrown building with
                    blaring lights. The inside of the restaurant is even
                    more intriguing, we decided that the best course of
                    action to make our restaurant substantial was to make
                    something similar to the Rainforest Cafe. If you'd like
                    more information on our restaurant, click the itinerary
