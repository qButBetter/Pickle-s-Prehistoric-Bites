                <h2>About Park & Restaurant</h2>
                Our restaurant, Pickle's Prehistoric Bites, is located near
                the Safari Lodge on Isla Nublar. It's not particularly hard
                to find, although if you need a map there is one listed
                below. The Safari Lodge is located near the top center
                of Isla Nublar. A general overview of the outside of
                the restaurant is a flashy, overgrown building with
                blaring lights. The inside of the restaurant is even
                more intriguing, we decided that the best course of
                action to make our restaurant substantial was to make
                something similar to the Rainforest Cafe. If you'd like
                more information on our restaurant, click the itinerary
