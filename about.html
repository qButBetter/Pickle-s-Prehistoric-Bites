            <h2>How it Started</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey into the world of culinary exploration was deeply rooted in a shared fascination with exotic
                meats. The initial spark of inspiration came to us as we saw the first dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The
                spectacle of these ancient creatures roaming the Earth ignited our imaginations and left us pondering
                the thrilling possibility of bringing a piece of that prehistoric world to the dining table. From that
                moment on, we were committed to offering a truly unique and immersive dining experience that allowed
                people to savor the flavors of exotic meats, and what could be more extraordinary than indulging in the
                culinary adventure of tasting dinosaur meat? It was this passion and ambition that led us to embark on
                the extraordinary journey of opening our restaurant, where we are proud to bring the concept of exotic
                dining to life.

                    Tameem Mahmoud, (born April 14, 2006) is known as being the right hand man to the master chef
                    James "Pickle" Steed. Unlike his ridiculous master Tameem is more 'calm' and collected but does
                    have a silly side of him that comes out from time to time. This sou chef is the perfect second in
                    command for James Steed.

                    James Steed, (born February 10, 2007) a silly man and restaurateur known for his highly acclaimed
                    dishes and drinks but perhaps best known in the early 21st century for his “gooberish” behavior that
                    he freely displays on tv commercials.

                <p>
                    Although our restaurant is usually busy and reservation only, there are times that you can snag a
                    table before the rush. The wait time to order appetizers ranges from Instant to 15 minutes at the
                    most. Our servers are of the highest quality, so don't fear ill-manners. Our chefs are very
                    efficient and will get your meal in a jiffy! If you wait more than 30 minutes total, you get a free
                    unlimited side-dish! We also have entertainment in the establishment to keep the visit enjoyable.
                    Such as dinosaur animatronics and “rain-storms” every half hour. Also, our mascot Pickle the
                    Velociraptor comes out to entertain every 2 hours in the form of a boxing match against 1 lucky
                    customer. So don't be late!
